### Usage

#### Search

Use the search bar to quickly find relevant information. Hit `s` to open search.

By default, searching for `term1 term2` will show pages where either of the terms are present ("OR"). Pages that contain both are returned foremost.

Custom search modifiers are [available](https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html), including:

- `+term1 +term2` to search for documents where both `term1` AND `term2` are present;
- `-term1` to search for documents where `term1` is NOT present;
- `ter*` to search for documents where a word begins with `ter` (wildcard).
